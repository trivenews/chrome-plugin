# DESCRIPTION

Trive™ is a social science consensus engine that researches and clarifies facts through
Human Swarmed crowd wisdom. We incent people to do primary research into news
stories, compensate them with our own coin, Trive Coin, and hash/stash the results on
the Block-Chain.

# Introduction

During the 2016 United States electoral process, \#FakeNews entered the popular
narrative. The competing disinformation interests consisting of United States, Russian
News and other media sources, new social media outlets like Breitbart and Huffington
Post, and the abject failure of mass-media polling to predict the outcome of the 2016
United States general election demonstrated that the current news process is broken.
Now more than ever, we find ourselves in the perpetual search for truth; in an age of
“fake news,” lies and deceit.

To that end, we, the authors of this whitepaper, came together to create a platform that
determines the “truth” in most scenarios. We have designed a process using the
“wisdom of crowds” as a tool to quickly analyze news stories and discover truth.

Equally important in the search for truth is the provenance and immutability of the
research effort. A well-researched truth is irrelevant if later the sources can be changed
to make it a lie. This is where the blockchain’s utility shines. By committing not only the
final information, but the copies of the primary sources, the research and details of the
process to the blockchain, we can guarantee the long-term sanctity of the truth Trive™
discovers...
